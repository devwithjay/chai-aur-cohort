  Question:
  You are working on a system that stores user profile information from multiple sources.
  Sometimes, the same user has two different records, and you need to merge them into a single object.

  Description:
  Write a function that takes two objects and merges them into one.
  If a key exists in both objects, the value from the second object should overwrite the value from the first object.

  Constraints:
  - Both inputs should be valid objects.
  - If an object is empty, return the other object as it is.
  - If both objects are empty, return {}.

  Function: mergeObjects
  Description: Merges two objects into one, with the second object overriding duplicate keys.

  @param {object} obj1 - The first object.
  @param {object} obj2 - The second object.

  @returns {object} The merged object.
*/

function mergeObjects(obj1, obj2) {
  // Merge obj1 and obj2 into a single object
}
