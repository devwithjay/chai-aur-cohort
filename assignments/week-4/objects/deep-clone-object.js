/*
  Question:
  You are working on a web application where objects contain nested properties.
  JavaScriptâ€™s built-in assignment (=) creates a shallow copy, meaning changes to the copied object will also affect the original.
  To prevent this, you need to create a deep copy of an object, ensuring that nested objects are also cloned properly.

  Description:
  Write a function that takes an object and returns a deep copy of it.

  Constraints:
  - The input should be a valid object.
  - The function should work with nested objects and arrays inside objects.
  - The function should not modify the original object.

  Function: deepClone
  Description: Returns a deep copy of the provided object.

  @param {object} obj - The object to be deeply cloned.

  @returns {object} A deep copy of the input object.
*/

function deepClone(obj) {
  // Return a deep copy of obj
}
