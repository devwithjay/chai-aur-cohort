// You need to implement the BankAccount constructor function and its prototype methods

function BankAccount(balance) {
  // Initialize balance and transactions properties
}

// Define deposit method on BankAccount's prototype

// Define withdraw method on BankAccount's prototype

// Define getTransactionHistory method on BankAccount's prototype
